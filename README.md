Description:

Touch Grass is an app that promotes creating new social connections in a time where social distancing is the norm. This app sends users to random points of interests to encourage social interaction. This repo is a fork of the orignal source code as the project is currently underconstruction and no longer has the backing needed to make it to production, so the app takes user to a home page where the game would be implemented at and instead has a link to a GoFundMe where supports can (hypothetically) donate so the app may make it to production and change the world. The app has the following features:

> MERN engineered
> features login/out function with CRUD functionality
> retreives weather info for user's convience
