  ## Description:
  
  Touch Grass is an app that promotes creating new social connections in a time where social distancing is the norm. This app sends users to random points of interests to encourage social interaction. The main app no longer has the backing to make it to production in the foreseeable future, so a spin off has been forked off the main project by a cofounder and the homepage of the app is linked to a goFundMe page so the app may one day have the backing to go into production and change the world.

  **note** as of 11:55pm July 23 2021 the app is not functional. We have an outstanding team working around the clock that will post an update the minuite the link works.
